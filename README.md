# WebGoat
## Overview
WebGoat is a purposefully insecure J2EE web application that is intended to teach web application security lessons. Users must demonstrate their understanding of a security issue in each lesson by exploiting a real vulnerability in the WebGoat application. In one of the lessons, for example, the user must use SQL injection to steal fake credit card numbers. The application is a realistic teaching environment that provides users with hints and code to help them better understand the lesson.
## This Repo
This repository contains the solutions to each WebGoat Challenge in the form of individual md files. Screenshots have been added to aid understanding visually, and links to topics and concepts used to solve the challenges have also been hyperlinked.
## Goal
Using WebGoat application challenges, so readers can lay a solid foundation for cybersecurity concepts.
